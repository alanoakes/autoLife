I made software to solve life's problems and it lead me to Jesus! Something to enjoy and a reminder of it all on my 8th year wedding anniversary 🤓👍

"We cannot stay forever on the “mount of transfiguration,” basking in the light of our mountaintop experience (see Mark 9:1-9). But we must obey the light we received there; we must put it into action.
(Oswald Chambers, [My Utmost For His Highest: The Burning Heart](https://utmost.org/the-burning-heart/) )"
